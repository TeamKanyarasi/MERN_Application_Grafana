# MERN_Application_Grafana

## Objective:
Develop an advanced monitoring solution for a MERN application using Grafana and Prometheus. This repository includes setting up detailed monitoring for a full-stack JavaScript application, including database, backend, and frontend performance metrics, as well as log aggregation and tracing.

 ### 1. MERN Application Setup:

   - Deploy a travel memory application in your local machine.

### 2. Integrate Prometheus:

   - Integrate Prometheus metrics into the Node.js backend. Use client libraries to expose custom metrics like API response times, request counts, and error rates.

   - Set up MongoDB monitoring using an exporter, such as MongoDB Exporter, to track database performance.

### 3. Enhance Grafana Dashboards:

   - Create advanced Grafana dashboards to display both the default and custom metrics from the MERN application.

   - Include detailed visualizations for backend performance, database health, and frontend performance (if possible).

### 4. Log Aggregation:

   - Integrate a log aggregation system (such as Loki, ELK Stack, or Fluentd) to collect and visualize logs from the MERN application.

   - Create a dashboard in Grafana to explore and analyze these logs.

### 5. Implement Distributed Tracing:

   - Set up distributed tracing in the application using tools like Jaeger or Zipkin.

   - Integrate tracing data into Grafana for a full view of request flows through the application stack.

### 6. Alerting and Anomaly Detection:

   - Develop sophisticated alerting rules in Grafana based on application-specific metrics and log patterns.

   - Explore anomaly detection with Grafana, using the gathered metrics and logs.
